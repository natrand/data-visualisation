# Data Visualization and Obesity Classification

Welcome to the Data Visualization and Obesity Classification repository. This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a dataset related to obesity and building a machine learning model for obesity classification using Python.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and can be found in the `data` directory. It includes a CSV file named `obesityclassification.csv` containing various features such as age, height, weight and gender.

## Jupyter Notebook Files

The primary Jupyter Notebook file in this repository is `obesity_classification.ipynb`. Here's an overview of its sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset, explore its structure, and perform initial data analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

3. **Feature Visualization**: Visualize dataset features to identify patterns and correlations.

4. **Obesity Classification Model**: Build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model for obesity classification.

5. **Model Interpretation**: Understand the trained model's decision-making process and feature importance.

6. **Conclusion**: Summarize findings, discuss model performance, and provide insights.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis and classification process:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/natrand/data-visualisation.git`.

2. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd data-visualisation`.

3. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`.

5. Open `obesity_classification.ipynb` and run each cell sequentially.
